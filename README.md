# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Database Schema Project

## Description:
This project involves the development of a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Database Schema for a manufacturing and supply chain company. The database aims to streamline operations from design to production, regulate departmental structures, and optimize material management and financial oversight, particularly focusing on invoice processing.

## Objectives:
Design and develop a robust ERP Database Schema to manage manufacturing operations efficiently.

Ensure precise employee management, product lifecycle oversight, and meticulous financial tracking.

Implement database normalization techniques to maintain data integrity and optimize database performance.

## Project Components:
###Repository Structure:
Organize the repository systematically for easy access and understanding.

### Primary and Foreign Keys:
Identify appropriate primary and foreign keys for all relations.

Document primary keys and foreign keys in the finalized Entity-Relationship (EER) model.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER):
Illustrate relationships using a comprehensive and precise EER diagram.

### Relational Schema Transformation:
Transform provided data into a relational schema.

Describe unary, binary, and ternary relationships, and enumerate all binary relationships.

Establish integrity constraints using specific database constraints.

### Normalization and Functional Dependencies:
Identify functional dependencies and anomalies in each relation.

Normalize the schema to adhere to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

### SQL Queries and Oracle Apex Integration:
Write SQL queries to address specific data inquiries.

Utilized Oracle Apex for data visualization and interaction.

## Learning Value:
This project offers profound immersion into various DBMS concepts, including normalization, schema design, and SQL query optimization, is a key takeaway.
